#Retail Sales Analysis Project
This repository contains a PostgreSQL-based project for analyzing retail sales data. The project includes a retail_sales table with columns for transaction details (e.g., date, time, category, quantity, total sale) and a series of SQL queries for data cleaning, exploration, and business insights. Key features include:-

(i) Data cleaning to handle NULL values.
(ii) Exploration of sales volume, unique customers, and categories.
(iii) Business queries to find sales by date, category performance, customer demographics, and top-selling months.
(iv) Shift-based order analysis (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).
